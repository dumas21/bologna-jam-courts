# Sound Effects for Playground Jam App

The following sound files are used in this app for basketball-themed audio feedback:

- `admin.mp3`: Sound played when logging in as admin
- `click.mp3`: Basketball bounce sound for button clicks
- `error.mp3`: Basketball buzzer sound for errors
- `login.mp3`: Basketball swish sound for successful login
- `register.mp3`: Basketball net sound for registration
- `tab.mp3`: Basketball dribble sound for tab switching
- `checkin.mp3`: Basketball crowd cheer for check-in
- `checkout.mp3`: Basketball whistle for check-out
- `select.mp3`: Basketball bounce for playground selection

These sounds are basketball-themed to match the 80s/90s retro arcade game experience with Nike-style energy.

Note: If any sound files are missing, the app will continue to function normally but will log an error to the console.
